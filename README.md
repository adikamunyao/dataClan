The problem we aim to solve is to provide a solution for digitizing and securely storing handwritten notes, while ensuring the accuracy of data entry. With the increasing need for remote work and distance learning, it is essential to have a system that can easily convert handwritten notes into a digital format that can be easily stored, searched, and shared. However, this process can be time-consuming and error-prone when done manually.

### Technical Objectives
Develop a machine learning model that can recognize different styles of handwriting, so that it can accurately convert handwritten notes into digital format.
Create a database to store the digitized notes in a secure and organized manner.
Implement encryption and other security measures to protect the privacy of the notes.

### Usability Objectives
Develop a user-friendly interface that is easy to use, even for people who are not tech-savvy.
Allow users to easily upload their handwritten notes to the system.

### Evaluation Objectives
Test the accuracy of the machine learning model in recognizing different styles of handwriting.
Evaluate the user interface and ensure that it is easy to use and meets the needs of the target audience.
Conduct user testing to evaluate the usability and functionality of the system.

### Documentation Objectives
Develop user manuals and training materials to help users understand how to use the system.
Document the technical details of the system, such as the algorithms used for character recognition and the security measures implemented.
Provide clear and concise documentation to assist with maintenance and future development of the system.
