## PenPal: Providing a solution for digitizing and securely storing handwritten notes

## Introduction

Writing things down by hand is an important way of keeping information for the future, but it can easily get ruined or lost. Saving handwritten documents digitally is important so that they can be easily searched and kept safe. However, because everyone's handwriting is different, it's tricky to do this. Penpal helps to solve this problem.
Handwritten text recognition (HTR) is a way to use a computer to read and understand words that are written by hand. To do this, the computer needs to be able to separate the words and read them in the right order. Scientists are always working on new and better ways to do this, like using different combinations of neural networks.
Recently, a new type of neural network called a \"vision transformer\" has been used to analyze images. They have been really good at recognizing images and have worked just as well as the best neural networks. In this project, the scientists will explore using vision transformers to recognize handwritten text.

## Overview
There is a need for a solution to digitize and securely preserve handwritten notes while retaining data input accuracy. As remote work and online learning become more common, there is an increasing demand for a system that can effectively transform handwritten notes into a searchable, storable, and shareable digital version. The manual process of digitizing handwritten notes. However, this process can be time-consuming and error-prone when done manually.

# Challenges
* There are a few big challenges when it comes to teaching a computer to read handwritten text. One of the biggest challenges is creating a big enough dataset of labeled handwritten text to train the machine learning model. If there isn't enough data, then transfer learning might need to be used.
* Another key challenge is teaching the computer to recognize words that it hasn't been specifically trained on. This is important if the computer is going to be able to read text in different languages. Currently, most of the available datasets are in English, so this is a big challenge. The computer will also only be able to recognize letters and numbers from the Latin alphabet.


## Objectives

### Technical Objectives
Develop a machine learning model that can recognize different styles of handwriting, so that it can accurately convert handwritten notes into digital format.
Create a database to store the digitized notes in a secure and organized manner.
Implement encryption and other security measures to protect the privacy of the notes.

### Usability Objectives
Develop a user-friendly interface that is easy to use, even for people who are not tech-savvy.
Allow users to easily upload their handwritten notes to the system.

### Evaluation Objectives
Test the accuracy of the machine learning model in recognizing different styles of handwriting.
Evaluate the user interface and ensure that it is easy to use and meets the needs of the target audience.
Conduct user testing to evaluate the usability and functionality of the system.

### Documentation Objectives
Develop user manuals and training materials to help users understand how to use the system.
Document the technical details of the system, such as the algorithms used for character recognition and the security measures implemented.
Provide clear and concise documentation to assist with maintenance and future development of the system.
